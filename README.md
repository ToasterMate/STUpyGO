(THE README IS STILL A W.I.P!!!)

Stu.pyGO is a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) based on the Python Terminal that allows you to study words efficiently and quickly the same way that you can do it on programs like Quizlet and StudyGO.

# THE BASICS

## From what I have tested it works on both Windows and Linux, but you need to have the following installed:
  - Python (preferably the latest version (3.11 at the time of writing))
  - Pip, so that you can install the following:
      - Tkinter (Pip install tk)

  _I assume that you know how to execute the program itself, I will not explain that part._
